# iaGO-OS

3-person AI consultancy (CEO on Windows, CTO on Mac).
Claude Code configuration layer for multi-client project delivery.
Stack is fixed — do not suggest alternatives unless explicitly asked.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React 19 + Vite + TypeScript (strict) + TailwindCSS 4 + ShadCN/UI
- **Backend:** AWS Amplify Gen 2 + Lambda (Node.js 20) + API Gateway + DynamoDB + Cognito + SES
- **Agents:** Claude SDK (Anthropic) + LangGraph + n8n
- **Testing:** Vitest (unit/integration), Playwright (E2E)
- **Tooling:** Biome (formatter + linter) — never Prettier, ESLint, or gofmt
- **Infra:** AWS CDK, GitHub Actions CI/CD

## Code Standards

- TypeScript strict — no `any`, no `as` casts (except type guards), no `@ts-ignore`
- Named exports only — no default exports
- Functional components only — no class components
- `use()` + `<Suspense>` for data fetching — no useEffect for data loading
- Error boundaries for component-level error handling
- Colocation: component + test + styles in same directory
- File naming: kebab-case files, PascalCase components, camelCase utilities
- Barrel files (`index.ts`) only at public API boundaries
- Imports: external deps first, then internal with `@/` aliases
- ShadCN/UI + TailwindCSS 4: always verify setup against official ShadCN docs — Vite setup differs from Next.js

## Architecture

- DynamoDB single-table design — access patterns drive schema, not entity relationships
- Lambda: thin handler wrappers calling domain logic modules
- Cognito JWT validation in API Gateway authorizer, not in Lambda handlers
- Amplify Gen 2: `defineBackend`, `defineAuth`, `defineData`, `defineFunction`
- TanStack Query for server state, React Context for UI state only
- Feature folders: `src/features/{name}/` with components, hooks, api, types
- No ORMs — DynamoDB DocumentClient with typed helpers
- Form handling: React Hook Form + Zod validation

## Workflow

Phases: init → discuss → plan → execute → verify. See `/iago:*` skills.
Quick modes: `/iago:fast` (trivial, ≤3 files) | `/iago:quick` (1-3 tasks, composable flags).
Artifacts: `.iago/plans/`, `.iago/context/`, `.iago/summaries/`, `.iago/reviews/`.
STATE.md is a digest — keep under 80 lines. Overflow decisions to PROJECT.md.
Pause: `/iago:pause`. Resume is automatic on next session start.

## Verification

Never claim a task is complete without running a verification command and reading its output.
"Tests pass" means you ran them and saw green. "Build succeeds" means you ran it and saw exit 0.
Do not assert outcomes — demonstrate them.

## Search First

Before creating any new file, component, or utility, search the codebase for existing implementations.
Duplication is a bug.

## Agent Escalation Protocol

Every subagent MUST end its response with exactly one status:

- **DONE** — requirements verified with evidence (test output, build success)
- **DONE_WITH_CONCERNS** — requirements met, minor issues listed
- **NEEDS_CONTEXT** — state exactly what information is missing
- **BLOCKED** — state the external blocker; do not retry without resolving it

## Execution Discipline

7+ consecutive Read/Grep/Glob without Edit/Write/Bash: STOP. State findings, ask
whether to continue reading or start writing. Exception: research/analysis/review
tasks may read freely but must produce a written artifact before reporting DONE.

3 failed fix attempts on the same issue: STOP. Report failure pattern, escalate.
No 4th attempt without new information or a different approach.

During execution, implement only what the plan specifies. New ideas go to deferred.
Auto-fix bugs, missing imports, and blocking issues. ASK before architectural changes.

## Rules

Detailed rules in `.claude/rules/`:
- `tdd.md` — RED-GREEN-REFACTOR, rationalization prevention, 80% coverage
- `systematic-debugging.md` — 4-phase debugging, 3-fix escalation
- `git-workflow.md` — branching, PRs, merge strategy
- `available-skills.md` — full skill and agent catalog
- `react-vite.md` — React 19 + Vite patterns *(path-scoped: `src/**/*.tsx`)*
- `aws-amplify.md` — Amplify Gen 2 + DynamoDB + Lambda *(path-scoped: `amplify/**`)*
- `e2e-testing.md` — Playwright conventions *(path-scoped: test files)*
- `mcp-server-patterns.md` — MCP Node/TS SDK *(path-scoped: MCP files)*

## Skills

Core: `/brainstorming`, `/writing-plans`, `/subagent-driven-development`, `/code-review`, `/deep-research`, `/prompt-optimizer`.
Workflow: `/iago:init`, `/iago:discuss`, `/iago:plan`, `/iago:execute`, `/iago:verify`, `/iago:fast`, `/iago:quick`, `/iago:pause`.
See `.claude/rules/available-skills.md` for the complete catalog including content, experimental, and industry skills.

## Agents

11 agents in `.claude/agents/`: implementer, code-reviewer, spec-reviewer, code-quality-reviewer, researcher, tdd-guide, build-error-resolver, e2e-runner, content-writer, infra-runner, data-modeler.
All on Sonnet. Hub-and-spoke: only the orchestrator (this session) dispatches agents — agents never spawn other agents.

## Model Routing

- **Opus:** Orchestrator (main session) — planning, architecture, multi-file reasoning
- **Sonnet:** All subagents — implementation, review, research, debugging, testing
- **Haiku:** Reserve for mechanical tasks (formatting, simple lookups) when needed
- **Codex (GPT-5.4):** Cross-model review (`/codex:review`, `/codex:adversarial-review`) and rescue delegation (`/codex:rescue`)
